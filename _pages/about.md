I am currently a Computer Science PhD student at UC Santa Cruz working under Narges Norouzi in the Applied Machine Learning Lab. I am currently researching self supervised deep learning methods for biomedical signals characterization, recognition, and classification. Moreover, I enjoy exploring the theoretical aspects of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science.
